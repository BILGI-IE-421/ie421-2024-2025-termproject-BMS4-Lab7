# From Education to Employment: Strategic Career Planning Based on Industry Trends
The purpose of this project is to provide a data-driven framework for individuals to make informed career decisions by analyzing the interplay between education levels, sector dynamics, and future industry trends. By examining factors such as earnings potential, unemployment rates, sector income distribution, and projected growth, this study aims to guide individuals in aligning their educational choices with sectors that offer the best opportunities for long-term success. The ultimate goal is to empower people, particularly those at the beginning of their career journeys, to strategically plan their paths in a way that balances personal aspirations with economic realities, ensuring both professional fulfillment and financial stability.
